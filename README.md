# usc-skateboard-stats
This is an extension of my USC Applied Statistics Course Project. USC students love skateboards. In this notebook, I analyze how USC skateboard traffic varies by time, gender, skateboard type and other interesting factors. See my analysis at https://github.com/jiaxuan-lu/usc-skateboard-stats/blob/master/USC%20Skateboard%20Traffic%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb.
